<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yuanhao Liu（刘元浩）, a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, affiliated with the National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Algorithm Security, under the supervision of Prof. Huawei Shen（沈华伟）. I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from the School of Software, Nankai University, in 2020.

My research investigates algorithmic fairness, with the aim of developing technologies that are fair, trustworthy, and socially responsible. Please feel free to email me at <a href='liuyuanhao.cn@gmail.com'>liuyuanhao.cn@gmail.com</a> for any form of academic communication or collaboration.

I have published papers at the top international AI conferences such as WWW, SIGIR, CSCW.

["I Know You Are Discriminatory!": Automated Substantiating for Individual Fairness Auditing of AI Systems](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Yuanhao Liu**, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Kaike Zhang, Yunfan Wu, Xueqi Cheng

[**Code**]()
- Designed auditing techniques to evaluate individual fairness in AI systems when access to model internals and training data is restricted, and developed substantiating frameworks for fairness violations.
